# Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. Below is a list of algorithms that need to be implemented:

1. Linear Regression [x]
2. Logistic Regression [x]
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)[x]
7. Naive Bayes
8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
10. k-Means Clustering
11. Hierarchical Clustering
12. Apriori Algorithm (Association Rule Learning)
13. Collaborative Filtering (Recommendation Systems)
14. Neural Networks (Multi-layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc.)
15. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, etc.)

Feel free to add more algorithms or sub-algorithms as needed. Let's collaborate to implement these algorithms and build a comprehensive machine learning library!
