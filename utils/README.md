## Utils

The `utils` folder contains utility functions and helper modules for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization. Below is a list of utilities that should be implemented:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - StandardScaler: Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
   - MinMaxScaler: Scale features to a specified range (e.g., between 0 and 1).
   - One-Hot Encoder: Encode categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
   - Data Splitter: Split data into training and testing sets.

2. Model Evaluation:
   - Confusion Matrix: Compute and visualize the confusion matrix for classification models.
   - ROC Curve: Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for binary classifiers.
   - Precision-Recall Curve: Plot the precision-recall curve for binary classifiers.
   - Cross-Validation: Implement k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.

3. Visualization:
   - Scatter Plot: Plot scatter plots for data exploration and visualization.
   - Histogram: Generate histograms for feature distribution analysis.
   - Line Plot: Plot line graphs for time series data or continuous variables.
   - Heatmap: Create heatmaps for correlation analysis and feature importance visualization.

4. Other Utilities:
   - Feature Selection: Implement feature selection techniques such as recursive feature elimination (RFE) or feature importance ranking.
   - Model Serialization: Serialize trained models for saving and loading.
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

Feel free to add more utility functions or modules as needed to support data processing, model evaluation, and visualization tasks in machine learning projects. Let's collaborate to create efficient and versatile utility tools!
